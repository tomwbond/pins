### topic 3

trying out **paragraphs**, apparently they need to be separated using two blank spaces and a return. controversial though because of the strange people who add two spaces after paragraphs.  
here we go. so here's testing moving to a new line without two spaces so
***this*** text should stay on the same line?  
now onto a new line line and the ***triple*** asterisk for extra emphasis is lovely.

### topic 4

so can i use markdown instead of html? like make an html page then call in the markdown from another file and write my content like this? because if so, that is so much nicer.

### topic 5
