## Things to see and do

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Edinburgh+Castle/@55.9482575,-3.1996799,18z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4887c79a2099c0f7:0x469a1eebe54c0a58!8m2!3d55.9485947!4d-3.1999135!16zL20vMGpwbl8?entry=ttu" target="_blank">Edinburgh Castle</a>

One of the city’s top attractions, the Castle is absolutely worth a visit. There’s fascinating history and great views here. The National War Museum is fantastic and there are lots of other small museums to check out. At 1pm, there’s also usually the firing of the cannon to watch. At 1pm, there’s also usually the firing of the cannon – a tradition to help sailors in the Forth know the time. In November 23 tickets were about £20 and it’s easy to spend half a day here.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Edinburgh+Zoo/@55.9423613,-3.2788932,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4887c661482ca367:0xdab93fa996cd02cb!8m2!3d55.9423619!4d-3.2685938!16zL20vMDcxNG5x?entry=ttu" target="_blank">Edinburgh Zoo</a>

A large and interesting zoo that’s a great place to spend a few hours. Buses from the city centre take about 20 minutes and stop outside. On a drizzly day in November, plenty of animals were in their hides and enclosures closed for renovation. But it was still great, and nice to support all the zoo’s great conservation work. In November 23 entry was £25 and 2-3 hours was enough (but on a better day you could spend longer).

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Royal+Botanic+Garden+Edinburgh/@55.9568377,-3.2208141,14z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4887c7c1de08e6eb:0x6305a87387d5746e!8m2!3d55.9650125!4d-3.2091021!16zL20vMDQ2ZHEx?entry=ttu" target="_blank">Royal Botanic Garden</a>

A large, beautiful park on the northern edge of the New Town, the Botanic Garden is a really good visit. There’s an excellent visitor centre and cafe (and the shop was the nice we saw). There’s lots of paths, history and conservation work going on, as well as relevant art to see. It’s free to enter and might take 1-3 hours, depending on how much you want to see.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/National+Museum+of+Scotland/@55.9479034,-3.192343,16z/data=!3m1!5s0x4887c784db00984f:0xbcf28f76719eeb7d!4m6!3m5!1s0x4887c784d1bae421:0x88cc2703f2beb5c3!8m2!3d55.9469995!4d-3.1905666!16zL20vMDRmZnMx?entry=ttu" target="_blank">National Museum of Scotland</a>

Large, varied and excellent museum. There’s a really impressive set of floors covering Scottish history from its geological foundations to the present day – moving through eras as you move upwards. Other areas include: the natural world, world cultures, art, design and fashion, and science and technology. It’s free to enter. Highly recommended.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/The+Real+Mary+King's+Close/@55.9491649,-3.1950467,16z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4887c7855b8459c9:0xcb64f411cf647589!8m2!3d55.949921!4d-3.1905063!16zL20vMGZ6dnlm?entry=ttu" target="_blank">The Real Mary King’s Close</a>

On the Royal Mile near the Castle, this is a great interactive tour exploring rooms and streets that were built over. It’s taken by guides who are ‘in character’ and vividly brings living in the Old Town to life. It takes about an hour and cost £21.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Calton+Hill/@55.9492851,-3.1896608,16z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4887c7896e46c799:0x9181b664f75766dd!8m2!3d55.9550465!4d-3.1827409!16zL20vMDU2OHhy?entry=ttu" target="_blank">Calton Hill</a>

This place helped inspire Edinburgh’s ‘Athens of the North’ nickname because of the unfinished classical monument. There are fantastic views of the city up here, as well as several other monuments and contemporary art exhibitions. A must-see, especially if you can get here when the light is good.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Arthur's+Seat/@55.9436274,-3.1786755,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4887b979c8b4febf:0x98aa0e77e2bfa9a8!8m2!3d55.9440862!4d-3.1618326!16s%2Fg%2F11r6ldqv5k?entry=ttu" target="_blank">Arthur’s Seat</a>

The highest point in Holyrood Park, Arthur’s Seat is a key local landmark. From the city centre allow about an hour to get to the top. The views are worth it. It’s a decent walk but not hugely challenging. If it’s wet you’ll want some decent trainers or walking shoes.

### <a href="https://edinburghfreetour.com/" target="_blank">Old Town walking tour</a>

Always a great way to start a holiday, this company runs several tours starting in the Old Town. We did this one, as well as the night time Ghost tour.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/St+Giles'+Cathedral/@55.949177,-3.1927078,16z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4887c7854ff703fd:0xaa24e716571e2ff2!8m2!3d55.9494837!4d-3.1908918!16zL20vMDJxamNy?entry=ttu" target="_blank">St. Giles’ Cathedral</a>

A beautiful, peaceful building right in the centre of the old town, there’s been a church on the site for 900 years.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/The+Writers'+Museum/@55.947863,-3.2011632,16z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4887c79aa32b907f:0x6d9daae3b9199343!8m2!3d55.9496581!4d-3.1937817!16s%2Fm%2F0n473zr?entry=ttu" target="_blank">The Writer’s Museum</a>

This small museum is inside a famous Old Town building (which you’ll be shown from the outside on the walking tour). With rooms covering three of Scotland’s most famous writers, this is a great way to spend up to an hour. It’s also free to enter.

### National Galleries of Scotland (<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/National+Galleries+of+Scotland:+National/@55.9515558,-3.1983512,16z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4887c648eae6c6eb:0xc47f9545e742193!8m2!3d55.950902!4d-3.1956862!16zL20vMGhoaGI?entry=ttu" target="_blank">National</a>, <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/National+Galleries+of+Scotland:+Portrait/@55.9521205,-3.2011192,16z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4887c648eae6c6eb:0x2be348d68265ff86!8m2!3d55.9554998!4d-3.1935213!16zL20vMDQ5NHAw?entry=ttu" target="_blank">Portrait</a>)

Two of the best galleries in Scotland, both are easy to get to and have beautiful collections. They’re also free to enter. You can also find Modern One and Modern Two just a little way out of the city centre.

## Cafes and coffee shops

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Guajira+Caf%C3%A9+%26+Coffee/@55.950178,-3.1838582,16z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4887c720785b8009:0x7f4c14a200788cab!8m2!3d55.9502065!4d-3.1837226!16s%2Fg%2F11spkc_psy?entry=ttu" target="_blank">Guajira Café & Coffee</a>

A newish place when we visited in November 23, this is a fantastic little venue just off the Royal Mile. It serves Latin American and Caribbean food with a simple, affordable menu. Everything (all-day breakfast, toasties, wraps, etc) is delicious and the drinks are good too. A must-visit.


### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Bobby's+Sandwich+Bar/@55.9470768,-3.1924102,16z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4887c784cd2773cb:0xb8c64b577c31f978!8m2!3d55.9466325!4d-3.1912453!16s%2Fg%2F11bwv39fzn?entry=ttu" target="_blank">Bobby’s Sandwich Bar</a>

A tiny place outside the famous Greyfriars Kirk, this cafe serves excellent (and very cheap) homemade lentil soup, which is absolutely perfect on a chilly November day.

## Pubs and bars

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/The+Bow+Bar/@55.9488497,-3.1929599,16z/data=!3m1!5s0x4887c79aee3a64b1:0x495b76f3ba829ebe!4m6!3m5!1s0x4887c79aefe8b561:0x3276586be2f706f0!8m2!3d55.9484535!4d-3.1941781!16s%2Fg%2F1tds68kc?entry=ttu" target="_blank">The Bow Bar</a>

A cosy, warm and friendly pub with hundreds of types of whiskey and a great range of locally- and independently-made beers. This is a seriously good bar on the famous Victoria Street, right in the heart of the Old Town.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/The+Jazz+Bar/@55.9503351,-3.1969034,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4887c785b1ecee97:0xecc724d01a4f6a34!8m2!3d55.9481648!4d-3.1869456!16s%2Fg%2F1tdfmvm6?entry=ttu" target="_blank">The Jazz Bar</a>

This lively underground bar has a packed and diverse schedule with bands playing every night into the early hours. We saw a band playing adaptations of music from Star Wars and other films which included the crowd going wild for the song from the cantina.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Cold+Town+House/@55.9471369,-3.1978551,16z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4887c7e545d7663b:0x384895732fddbc89!8m2!3d55.9473519!4d-3.1978111!16s%2Fg%2F11fk1h60jc?entry=ttu" target="_blank">Cold Town House</a>

Down the hill from the Castle, this is a large, modern taproom serving good food and craft beer brewed on-site. There’s also a great garden/terrace.


### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/The+Caley+Picture+House+-+JD+Wetherspoon/@55.9467799,-3.2062446,17z/data=!3m1!5s0x4887c79875cfcfb1:0x4906aed403d9d9c9!4m6!3m5!1s0x4887c79875ff5fdd:0x626a4692467f26a1!8m2!3d55.9482418!4d-3.2061343!16s%2Fm%2F0tkk0mb?entry=ttu" target="_blank">The Caley Picture House</a>

This is a Wetherspoons! Edinburgh has a couple of really interesting Spoons restaurants, and this is one of them. Serving the same (for my non-UK friends: cheap but not great) food and drink as all the others, this one used to be a cinema and might be the coolest Spoons I’ve visited.

## Shops

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Wonderland+Models/@55.9462568,-3.2080038,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4887c7989a0a895b:0xa2f638d7d7b48e6a!8m2!3d55.9462561!4d-3.2054345!16s%2Fg%2F1tdcfysw?entry=ttu" target="_blank">Wonderland Models</a>

Absolutely my kind of place, this is a large and varied model shop packed with interesting toys! There’s a huge range model kits and just fun to look around (if you’re like me, that is).

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/The+Nutcracker+Christmas+Shop/@55.9502803,-3.1859049,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4887c7854ff703fd:0xe61f17ff84ebc604!8m2!3d55.9502803!4d-3.1859049!16s%2Fg%2F1tdl5p_l?entry=ttu" target="_blank">The Nutcracker Christmas Shop</a>

A charming, warm and friendly little place on the Royal Mile, this is a great shop if you’re in the market for some Christmas-themed souvenirs.
