This is a must-see if you're in this part of Turkey (and into your ancient history, of course). Ephesus is a sprawling ancient Roman city with famous landmarks like the Library of Celsus and the Grand Theatre. It used to sit alongside the water, before the coast moved significantly further west. There are stunningly preserved buildings and streets, as well as a large covered excavation site showing home interiors with frescoes.

Separate from the main site, you can find what's left of the Temple of Artemis, as well as the museum which is back in the village of Selçuk. This is a great place to start your visit and get a sense of the place.

We walked from the station to the museum, then the Temple, then to the full Ephesus site. It's doable but pretty far, especially on a hot day. We got a taxi back to town.

Selçuk itself is accessible by an easy direct metro train from Izmir.

Another stunning destination for a lover of ancient cities, you arrive at Hierapolis by climbing up the extraordinary Pamukkale, or "Cotton Palace". It looks a bit like snow, but is actually a calcified hillside with a lot of small water pools.

Once at the top, the sprawling spa city of Hierapolis stretches off in all directions. I spent a few good hours exploring it from end to end. There a hot natural springs here so make sure to bring something to swim in. You can pretend to be one of the Romans or Byzantines who visited the place to restore their health!

The city has amazing views across the landscape which can enjoy sat down in one of the theatres.

To get there, we took a train from Izmir to Denizli, and then a local bus from there to Pamukkale. <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Denizli+%C5%9Eehirler+aras%C4%B1+Otob%C3%BCs+Terminali/@37.7857598,29.0905146,19z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14c73fb5238ca73b:0x159421cb8e9bdbd4!8m2!3d37.7854949!4d29.0909569!16s%2Fg%2F11cjkq6m6y?entry=ttu" target="_blank">This is the bus terminal</a> although I couldn't tell you the bus number!

Pamukkale has plenty of hotels to choose from. I stayed in the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Venus+Suite+Hotel/@37.912068,29.118253,16z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x14c713cbd2af9f05:0x63b62652e2c82e1e!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d37.9119395!4d29.1188014!16s%2Fg%2F1tkjnpyl?entry=ttu" target="_blank">Venus Suite Hotel</a> which was clean and modern with a good breakfast.
