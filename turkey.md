# Turkey

I visited in 2023.

## Currency

Turkey’s lira (TRY) has experienced a lot of inflation in recent years, which makes prices written by visitors a bit unreliable. Something that cost 100 TRY a couple of years ago might be more than double that now. At the same time, the currency has devalued, so your dollars, pounds, or euros will go further, so for most foreigners, it probably evens out. I include conversion into £ to give you a general idea.

There are ATMs everywhere, but the usual rules apply: try to find one that doesn’t charge, or doesn’t charge much, for your currency. I used HSBC ATMs, which you can find in Istanbul and Izmir. The latter is a bit weirdly marked on Google Maps (it’s not here).

In January 2023, I used Monzo and Starling for cash withdrawals and payments. Monzo has a £250/month ATM limit, while Starling is unlimited.

Cards are accepted in lots of places, but not everywhere, so it’s good to carry cash.

## Phone data/SIMs

Because Turkey wasn’t included on my roaming plan, for the first few weeks I used Wi-Fi and offline Google Maps with GPS. Eventually, I bought a local SIM, which is surprisingly expensive. There’s a ‘tourist’ version available from Turkcell (with a similar one at Vodafone) that includes 20GB of data. It cost 800 TRY/£35 in Feb 23. You can go into any Turkcell shop and they’ll set it up for you. You’ll need your passport!
