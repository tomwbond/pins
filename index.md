# Hello!

When planning trips, I mark interesting-looking places as ‘Want to go’ on Google Maps. Then, once I’ve been, I either mark them as a ‘Favourite’ or unmark them. Here, I list the places that make the cut, with a quick description and a Maps link.

## Italy

- Florence
- Rome

## Turkey

- [General info](turkey.md)
- Istanbul: things to see, eat and drink
- [Istanbul: working, sleeping, and getting around](istanbul1.md)
- [Izmir](izmir.md)

## UK

- [Edinburgh](edinburgh.md)
