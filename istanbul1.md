# Istanbul: working, sleeping, and getting around

## Places to stay

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Lotus+Garden+Hostel/@38.4206712,27.1424694,17.96z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x14bbd8f1f21c5e91:0x1283ad52275e5cf1!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d38.4204267!4d27.1434439!16s%2Fg%2F11btylp5dt" target="_blank">Lotus Garden Hostel</a>

A friendly, comfortable, old-fashioned hostel with a nice communal area, a decent kitchen, and a garden. My room – downstairs – had curtains and power points for each bed. Friendly, accommodating staff and a nice atmosphere. You can also use the washing machines, which is handy as Izmir doesn’t really have laundrettes. Remember to get a key if you’re staying out past midnight.

## Things to see and do

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Ataturk+Museum/@38.4374892,27.1409197,15.25z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14bbd85a305be291:0xd98decf832d0f057!8m2!3d38.4355952!4d27.1405833!16s%2Fg%2F11bzrprtwz" target="_blank">Atatürk Museum</a>

A fascinating little museum in a building with lots of history. Dedicated to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, a leader regarded as the founding father of modern Turkey, this free museum is definitely worth a visit.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Arkas+Art+Center/@38.43202,27.1352702,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14bbd8579a266dcb:0x9f6d3f801b05f566!8m2!3d38.4320199!4d27.1368178!16s%2Fg%2F11fnc9n508" target="_blank">Arkas Art Center</a>

A modern gallery with rotating exhibitions. When I visited, <a href=">https://arkassanatmerkezi.com/portfolio/lair-de-paris-paris-havasi/" target="_blank">‘Lair de Paris‘</a> was showing contemporary Turkish artists who visited Paris between 1945-1968.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/K%C3%BClt%C3%BCrpark+%C4%B0zmir/@38.4242664,27.1406709,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14bbd8f6303c6bc7:0xdf4d0f2b4b570776!8m2!3d38.4284811!4d27.145345!16s%2Fg%2F1s05v3nkt" target="_blank">Kültürpark İzmir</a>

A huge park in the centre of the city, there’s loads to do here. There’s a small theme park, a 2km running track (and lots of mini outdoor gyms), fountains, open areas, an open air theatre, Izmir Painting and Sculpture Museum, and Izmir History and Art Museum. I imagine there’s lots of music during the warmer months.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/%C4%B0zmir+Historical+Elevator+Building/@38.409079,27.1169417,17.42z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14bbd925a76e26f7:0xb540dfdc0bb32e47!8m2!3d38.4086587!4d27.1176455!16s%2Fm%2F02qt5rs" target="_blank">İzmir Historical Elevator Building</a>

A local landmark which is a lift to take residents from one level of the city to another, this structure dates to 1907. It’s free to go up and down, and there’s a nice cafe/restaurant at the top where you can enjoy the view. At the bottom, the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Frida+Cafe/@38.4086305,27.1155184,16.5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14bbd9780024d0ab:0x29f2ba0d439a7c92!8m2!3d38.4092463!4d27.1175635!16s%2Fg%2F11f5_k5r7t" target="_blank">Frida Cafe</a> – dedicated to the art of Frida Kahlo, is an interesting spot as well.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Bostanl%C4%B1+%C4%B0skelesi/@38.4560981,27.0968212,17.21z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14bbd997303e1acf:0xc5c368046d018674!8m2!3d38.4522361!4d27.0977008!16s%2Fg%2F11fpqqql9w" target="_blank">Karsiyaska</a>

The Karsiyaska district is a modern part of the city full of bars, cafes, and restaurants, as well as busy waterfront areas full of people enjoying the sun. You can get there easily on the ferry. My favourite bar here was Manje, but there’s a lot of choice, depending on what you’re after. The Karsiyaska ferry terminal is near the big modern shopping area, while the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Bostanl%C4%B1+%C4%B0skelesi/@38.4549312,27.0969227,17z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x14bbd997303e1acf:0xc5c368046d018674!2zQm9zdGFubMSxIMSwc2tlbGVzaQ!8m2!3d38.4522361!4d27.0977008!16s%2Fg%2F11fpqqql9w!3m5!1s0x14bbd997303e1acf:0xc5c368046d018674!8m2!3d38.4522361!4d27.0977008!16s%2Fg%2F11fpqqql9w?entry=ttu" target="_blank">Bostanlı İskelesi</a> terminal takes you to the cafe/bar area. That's the more interest part.

## Places to work

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/%C4%B0zQ+%C4%B0novasyon+Merkezi/@38.4283727,27.132503,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14bbd955b39f9741:0x1976a246b2751dc0!8m2!3d38.4269321!4d27.1328263!16s%2Fg%2F11sn6syryj" target="_blank">İzQ İnovasyon Merkezi</a>

A large office/innovation space right on the waterfront in Izmir. There’s a coworking space and a good cafe (which you can go to without a pass for the office). Website.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Baristocrat+Cafe+%26+Roastery+Alsancak/@38.4282046,27.1382536,17z/data=!3m1!5s0x14bbd8f9d398acc3:0x1c4435286c3ec122!4m6!3m5!1s0x14bbd8f78755ff23:0x1e6525b733856c9e!8m2!3d38.4285105!4d27.1383497!16s%2Fg%2F11bw5650w8" target="_blank">Baristocrat Cafe & Roastery</a>

Excellent, if expensive, small chain of cafes.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Brothers+Coffee+Roasters/@38.4317314,27.134784,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14bbd85793c86a07:0xadf84f851ffb46ef!8m2!3d38.4317314!4d27.1369727!16s%2Fg%2F11b7tvmwqd" target="_blank">Brothers Coffee Roasters</a>
A bit tightly packed, but a great spot for good coffee and a bit of working (or just coffee).

## Places to eat

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Ay%C5%9Fa/@38.4185644,27.133758,18z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14bbd8e444c475af:0xd141ae4c16ce0740!8m2!3d38.4187012!4d27.1343177!16s%2Fg%2F11c1q4crq5" target="_blank">Ayşa</a>

A must visit in Izmir. Tucked away in a courtyard in the bazaar, it’s a kind of buffet place with excellent, healthy, homemade food (including loads of vegetarian/vegan options) where you pay by weight. The service is great too. Very reliable when you don’t want another kebab.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@38.4204257,27.1411181,20.5z" target="_blank">Falafel Haleb</a>

A tiny food place serving tasty, cheap falafel kebabs. Odd hours and it’s not on Google Maps, but if you’re nearby, this is good. I returned a couple of times and enjoyed a falafel durum (wrap) in the small square opposite. 20 TRY/less than £1 in Feb 23.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Gar+1960/@38.421581,27.1421922,17.75z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14bbd8f1660fe547:0x637ea7bec94f23ae!8m2!3d38.4228838!4d27.1434471!16s%2Fg%2F11rc1nnbfv" target="_blank">Gar 1960</a>

A reliable, friendly restaurant alongside the train station, Gar serves pretty good breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It also has a bakery.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Pizza+Locale/@38.432892,27.1414228,18z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14bbd85922b97787:0xfcb76bb2252317e6!8m2!3d38.432477!4d27.142724!16s%2Fg%2F11byvs6hzk" target="_blank">Pizza Locale</a>

A modern pizza place serving a wide range of interesting options in several sizes.

## Places to drink

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Kovan/@38.437984,27.1419723,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14bbd85b10d3b081:0x2c5f990585fa05be!8m2!3d38.4376992!4d27.1425323!16s%2Fg%2F11c47xgn3z" target="_blank">Kovan</a>

A modern bar and restaurant that’s open late. It serves great food and drink and has a lively atmosphere and cool decor. A really great place.
