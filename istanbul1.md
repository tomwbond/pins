# Istanbul: things to see, eat and drink

## Museum Card

Available in two versions (5 days for Istanbul or 15 days for Turkey), this is *OK* value for money. I didn’t really save anything, but it does allow you to skip the ticket queues at each venue, which might be the more useful benefit if you’re visiting at busy times.

## Sultanahmet / old town

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Lotus+Garden+Hostel/@38.4206712,27.1424694,17.96z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x14bbd8f1f21c5e91:0x1283ad52275e5cf1!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d38.4204267!4d27.1434439!16s%2Fg%2F11btylp5dt" target="_blank">Grand Bazaar</a>

A huge, mostly indoor market. This is a great place to wander, get lost, and enjoy a coffee as you watch the world go by.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Topkapi+Palace+Museum/@41.0094256,28.9773693,16z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14cab9b8afa5f833:0x15aa1943c3015300!8m2!3d41.0115195!4d28.9833789!16zL20vMDFsZ2N3" target="_blank">Topkapi Palace</a>

Istanbul’s palace is a sprawling complex dating to the 1400s. Home to the sultans, it was the seat of the Ottoman empire for several hundred years. There’s a lot to see and there are lovely gardens and views over the city to enjoy. Allow 2-3 hours and make sure to also visit the Harem. The audio guide is worth getting. If the queue for the Chamber of Sacred Relics is very long then skip it. Entry is included in the Museum Card.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Suleymaniye+Mosque/@41.016047,28.9552164,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14cab98d3ac01031:0x8accf5042157cfed!8m2!3d41.016047!4d28.9639711!16zL20vMDJxNm1i" target="_blank">Suleymaniye Mosque</a>

A beautiful, ornate mosque with an open garden/terrace area that has great views north over the Golden Horn.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Hagia+Sophia+Grand+Mosque/@41.008583,28.9776001,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x14cab9be92011c27:0x236e6f6f37444fae!8m2!3d41.008583!4d28.980175!16zL20vMGJyNXE?entry=ttu" target="_blank">Hagia Sophia</a>

An ancient, enormous mosque in the heart of Sultanahmet, between the Blue Mosque (which was closed for renovations when I visited) and the Palace. Entrance is free but the queue is long. I went in the evening when the queue was gone and the atmosphere was serene.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Museum+of+Turkish+and+Islamic+Arts/@41.0062227,28.9685969,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14cab997c77fbc9d:0xfb3d29d1ea7af194!8m2!3d41.0062236!4d28.9747201!16s%2Fm%2F026v7b0" target="_blank">Museum of Turkish and Islamic Arts</a>

A fascinating museum with large collections of ancient artefacts and archaeological finds spanning many eras of Islamic civilization. It also has good information panels in English. Entry is included with the Museum Card.

### Walk or run along the Bosphorus

Passing north through Gülhane Park, join the waterfront path that wraps around Sultanahmet.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Basilica+Cistern/@41.0094256,28.9773693,16z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14cab9bde0c66ac9:0x60c02fe1ee6d8471!8m2!3d41.008384!4d28.977878!16zL20vMDR4MTg4" target="_blank">Basilica Cistern</a>

A stunning piece of Roman engineering, the Cistern, built in the 6th century, stored and distributed water for the city. The place is beautifully lit and includes exhibitions of sculptures. Allow 30-45 minutes. The queues can be quite long and entry is not included in the Museum Card.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/G%C3%BClhane+Park/@41.0126202,28.9802537,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14cab9c735bcda2b:0x65e6a6edfa646cb!8m2!3d41.0133079!4d28.9815101!16s%2Fm%2F02q19hs" target="_blank">Gülhane Park</a>

A pretty park in the centre of the city, this is a great spot for a walk, a run, or a sit down. There’s a couple of places to get a coffee too.

## Other areas

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Rahmi+M.+Ko%C3%A7+Museum/@41.0436716,28.9331577,15.75z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14cab0abafe5d4c1:0x44361327b10bbc5e!8m2!3d41.0425386!4d28.9491836!16zL20vMDg0anps?entry=ttu" target="_blank">Rahmi M. Koç Museum</a>

One of my personal favourites, this sprawling museum of transport, industry and communications has a huge collection of cars, planes, boats, trains and other vehicles, as well as machines, scientific things and models. It also has several cafes/restaurants. It’s a little out of town: I caught a bus (#33 maybe) from the station just west of Galata bridge. Allow three hours to see everything. It’s not included with the Museum Pass.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Harbiye+Military+Museum+and+Cultural+Site+Command/@41.042597,28.968647,14z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14cab70d7d3a7ec9:0x9a786bc365e36281!8m2!3d41.0481642!4d28.9878852!16zL20vMDhnd2h4?entry=ttu" target="_blank">Harbiye Military Museum</a>

A huge complex to the north of the city centre, this museum showcases thousands of military items from many eras and historical exhibits. Allow 1-2 hours. The Mehter military band also plays a daily concert (early afternoon?), which is fun and worth the extra ticket. The museum is not included in the Museum Pass.

One of my favourite bars in the city, Revolte is always busy, stays open late, serves great drinks, and has a fantastic atmosphere. If you’re in Kadikoy, don’t miss it.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Karga+Bar/@40.987961,29.0256437,17.75z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14cab866c44c2297:0xc657eea8ab6e69a4!8m2!3d40.9866119!4d29.0265598!16s%2Fg%2F1wgfmbrn" target="_blank">Karga Bar</a>

Just down the road from Revolte, Karga is another top bar in Kadikoy. With winding wooden staircases and lots of rooms, this atmospheric place is spread across several floors.

Just one of many bars, cafes and restaurants in this lively area, this pub serves a range of proper craft beer, which is a bit rare in Istanbul. Double-check the prices though… some drinks are super expensive.
