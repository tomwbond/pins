Right in the centre of the old town, this hostel is perfect for seeing the headline sights of Istanbul. It's got a bar, lots of rooms. This is a lively place that runs pub crawls and all that kind of thing.

Over in the trendy Kadikoy part of the city, this is a well-located hostel with great cafes, restaurants, and bars nearby, as well as a ferry stop. The beds are self-contained with curtains, which is always a big plus. This hostel is fairly quiet and a good when you need a break from the party hostels.

Great location in Sultanahmet. Clean, comfortable rooms and nice staff. It’s a new place without any atmosphere, but it’s reliable. I paid about €50 in January 2023.

## Places to work

### <a href="https://cobac.work/" target="_blank">CoBAC Workspace</a>

A modern, clean and well-equipped workspace, CoBAC has a beautiful roof terrace and a good cafe. Each floor also has a kitchen with free tea and coffee. The building has great views over the Golden Horn and is close to the ferry terminals in case you’re staying on the eastern side. In Jan/Feb 2023 a monthly hotdesk membership was ~£120. Dedicated desks are also available.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Moda+Pier/@40.9832468,29.0215963,16.25z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14cab91ff8fc388f:0x9d8808f8802a144!8m2!3d40.9789647!4d29.0250663!16s%2Fg%2F11fn4nmqqg?entry=ttu" target="_blank">Moda Pier</a>

Also a great spot for a coffee, Moda Pier has a small library and was full of people on laptops when I visited on a Sunday afternoon.

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Fiyeli+Coffee+co/@41.0125625,28.9764966,20z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14cab98a54d18957:0xa2dd43bf17090a46!8m2!3d41.0125625!4d28.9767267!16s%2Fg%2F11q38c3y2r?entry=ttu" target="_blank">Fiyelie Coffee</a>

A small, modern cafe in Sultanhamet, Fiyelie is a good spot for a couple of hours.

## Getting around

### Istanbul Airport (IST)

From the main airport, which is a surprisingly long way from the city, you can take the Havaist Bus iSt-12 (correct in January 23!) to Aksaray. You can then walk or take a tram or metro further into the city centre. 

When I was there, a new metro line was being developed to run from the airport to the centre. If that's open when you go, definitely use that instead.

### Istanbul Card

Valid on the metro, trams, buses, ferries, and even at public toilets, the travel card is definitely worth getting if you'll be staying for a few days. 

I ended up buying one of these from a street seller, and you can top it up at the bigger stations.

## Useful places

### <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Rainbow+Laundry/@41.0100227,28.9775677,21z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14cab9c0f623764b:0x44b528dd6be881d2!8m2!3d41.0100227!4d28.9777045!16s%2Fg%2F11fy4f_0n1" target="_blank">Ayasofia Laundry</a>

It’s not very clearly marked on the map, but looking up the hill from the front of Cheers Hostel, there’s a laundry place on the right hand side. In February 2023, it was 240 TRY (~£10) for 4kg of clothes.
